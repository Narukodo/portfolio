# Portfolio Website

portfolio website (for fun)

Reviewing the basic web dev stack using [Aleksei's tutorial](https://dev.to/alekseiberezkin/setting-up-react-typescript-app-without-create-react-app-oph).

# Getting Started

After cloning the repo, run

```
npm i
npm start
```

The website runs on port 3000

# Notes

This section will be updated as I update the code

## UX

- Pure pagination used because content is limited; scrolling is not required and also allows user to bookmark the pages they like
