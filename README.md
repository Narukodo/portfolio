# Portfolio Website

portfolio website (for fun)

Reviewing the basic web dev stack using [Aleksei's tutorial](https://dev.to/alekseiberezkin/setting-up-react-typescript-app-without-create-react-app-oph).

All the art in this project is mine. If you'd like to see more, feel free to look at my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Isukouhai) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/slimymush).

The focus of this project is on fancy page transitions and the basic lifecycle of web dev.

# Getting Started

After cloning the repo, run

```
npm i
npm start
```

The website runs on port 3000

# Notes

This section will be updated as I update the code

## Stack

I'm just using React for now to see how far I can take this.
Using Framer Motion for page transitions because it's much cleaner to use, and handles animations between pages with little to no effort.
